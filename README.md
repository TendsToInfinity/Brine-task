1- Create the main.py and test_case.py file

2- Create a docker file with requirements in it .

3- Now do the docker build 
docker build -t my-app .

4- Now do Docker Run once for the main.py file and then for test_cases.py 

> docker run -v $(pwd):/app my-app ( this should run the main.py file and printing the results based on the revenues and other parameters)

>docker run -v $(pwd):/app my-app python -m unittest test_cases.py ( This should run the test cases )

5- If you want to check the simple steps there is a Tasks.ipynb file which will show step by step process of the following  -
- Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the
dataset.
- Compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.
- Compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset.
- Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

6- You can even push the image to AWS ECR and run ECS by creating a  service and task definitions if needed to deploy .
